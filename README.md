Extended Description

The case study, inspired by the Wharton Casebook 2017, adapts the original "Penn & Teller" scenario for the Indian market, specifically targeting Goa’s tourism-driven entertainment sector. The analysis employs a structured framework to assess:





Profitability: Detailed revenue and cost calculations for both shows, including ticket sales, ancillary revenue (casino, dining, hotel stays), and setup costs.



Market Fit: Evaluation of Penn & Teller’s global appeal versus IGT’s local resonance, considering Goa’s competitive landscape (casinos, Bollywood shows, nightlife).



Risks and Opportunities: Cultural adaptation challenges, brand recognition, and strategies to enhance revenue (e.g., ticket bundles, merchandise). The recommendation to launch the IGT winner’s show is supported by a ₹5.72 crore profit advantage and a 3.5-year payback period for setup costs, with actionable next steps for marketing, cost optimization, and performance monitoring. This case study demonstrates strategic decision-making, financial analysis, and market insight, making it a valuable resource for aspiring consultants.
